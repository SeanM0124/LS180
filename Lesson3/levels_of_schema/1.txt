What are the three levels of schema?

1. Conceptual - Concerned mostly with bigger objects and high level concepts. Not concerned with how things are stored in the database
2. Logical - Often contains attributes and their data types. Not the typical level to work at.
3. Physical - Mostly concerned with the specifics of the database implementation of the conceptual model
